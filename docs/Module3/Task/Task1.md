# Task 1: Event Function Blocks

## Introduction

During lectures and self-study, you learned about IEC 61499 and its artifacts. This task is designed to help you develop an understanding of basic and composite function blocks (FBs), the concept of event-driven execution, and how to test your FBs by developing test applications.

## Task Description

Your goal is to reimplement the 4 Service-Interface Function Blocks from the standard library assigned to you. You should either develop basic or composite FBs and are encouraged to reuse FBs from the standard library where necessary.

## Report Structure

### Introduction

Describe the aim of the tasks and the intended learning outcomes. This section should be concise, not exceeding a quarter of a page.

### Requirements and Specifications of the System

List at least one requirement for each of your FBs. Illustrate these with timing diagrams that you need to redraw using PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
!includeurl <PLANTUML_SERVER>/timing-diagram.iuml
@enduml
```
